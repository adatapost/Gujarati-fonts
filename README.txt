These unicode fonts have been developed to enhance Gujarati font quality by a group of volunteers. The base font is Ekatra  which is based on Glyphs APU (non-unicode) which was based on original font (non-unicode) KRISHNA. Both APU and KRISHNA were copyright. However, we received approval to create unicode fonts using glyphs of APU from its creator. We believe these fonts are better designed and more complete than any other non-commercial Gujarati fonts.

We will continue to enhance them based not he feedback.

These fonts should work on all systems (Windows, Mac, Android, Web) and should have correct rendering of conjugate or complex characters. Please send your feedback via http://www.ekatrafoundation.org/%E0%AA%B8%E0%AA%82%E0%AA%AA%E0%AA%B0%E0%AB%8D%E0%AA%95/
